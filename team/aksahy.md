 ## Biography
 
 I am a Marie Curie Fellow with a background in bladder cancer, systems medicine and bioinformatics. I completed a position as a laboratory informatics systems (LIMS) manager at the CVR-CRUSH (COVID-19 Drug-Screening and Resistance Hub), University of Glasgow. Prior to this position, I was a bioinformatics scientific advisor for commercial entities named the Gene Box and SpeedGaze technologies solution Pvt Ltd. (Mumbai) after I completed my second postdoctoral fellowship at the Dell Medical Center – UT Austin, Texas, USA. I was also a visiting faculty for a bioinformatics
semester at the University of Mumbai and a research associate at the Indian Institute of Technology
Bombay. These labs were proteomics facilities and I worked as a computational biologist there. Earlier to this position, I was at the Vancouver Prostate Center as a postdoc, and a Marie Curie early-stage researcher (PhD.) at the Charite University Berlin in a bladder cancer project entitled
Mitacs Elevate fellowship (Canada) and BCMolMed (European Union). The project emphasized on a multidisciplinary approach in discovering bladder cancer biomarkers and included biotech industries, universities, and academic research centers. 

In the Mitacs Elevate/BCMolMed project, my tasks involved the bioinformatics modelling of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics changes in bladder cancer invasion patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. I am proficient in using statistical software R-bioconductor, bio-python
packages and network modelling tools from Cytoscape to integrate protein-interaction data and pathway enrichment databases for defining relevant biological processes in BC invasion. In addition, I have also used large scale public databases like TCGA, AACR GENIE, CPTAC, ProteomeXchange, GEO, SRA-EBI and ENCODE in order to download and analyse bladder, prostate, breast and colorectal cancer data. I have experience in handling and analyzing omics datasets from DNA/RNA sequencing (including CNV), gene expression microarrays and mass-spectrometry profiles. In the short term, I wish to apply my skills in programming and database management on discovering cellular signalling, protein-interactions, gene-regulatory and pathway enrichment networks involved in different cancer phenotypes. On the other hand, as future research, I intend to integrate -omics techniques with tissue image cytometry by using machine-learning and deep-neural networks algorithms in order to predict resistance to therapy in diseased patients and distinguish drug-responsive patients based on gene regulatory networks. In order to assimilate this knowledge, I had an opportunity to attend courses, workshops and conferences held by EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany, and Marie-Curie training programs within the last years.
