## Overview

This course offers an introduction to working with Linux for Bioinformatics. We will describe the Linux environment so that participants can start to utilize command-line tools and feel comfortable using a text-based way of interacting with a computer. We give example of processing data arising from Next-Generation Sequencing experiments, in particular an RNA-seq experiment.



## Who should attend this course?

Those wanting to use the command-line to perform data analysis; particularly those with next-generation sequencing data such as RNA-Seq

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- Connect to a Unix / Linux system
- Navigate around a file system by issuing commands; rather than using a Desktop environment
- Move and copy files and directories within the Linux system
- Work with text files
- Run programs from the command-line
- Run quality assessment tools on data derived from High-throughput sequencing experiments
 -Write short scripts to document an analysis


## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- Quality assessment of NGS data
- A basic workflow for processing RNA-seq data
- Workflow management systems; such as nextflow


## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required

## Software

- No software is required. You will be given access to an AWS machine on the day
