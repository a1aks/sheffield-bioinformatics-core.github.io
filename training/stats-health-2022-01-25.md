## Overview

During the course, the learners will learn about (1) variable types and distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson); (2) statistical thinking (correlations between continuous variables, the logic of hypothesis testing, predictive relationships); (3) various statistical models and making predictions - simple and general linear regression models, generalised linear models for binomial data (logistic regression) and linear mixed effect models for repeated measures.

**Note that you will need to be familiar with R to access this course. We have a course scheduled for the January 2022 that will cover sufficient background

## Who should attend this course?

The course is aimed primarily at scientists at all levels – especially those whose formal education likely included statistics, but who have not perhaps put this into practice since. 

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- Estimate the mean, variance and standard deviation of a variable through simulation.
- Calculate the size of a linear association between two variables using Pearson’s correlation.
- Describe the components that are involved in simple linear regression.
- Use the ggplot2 package to explore the relationship between two continuous variables.
- Calculate a prediction from a simple linear regression model using parameter estimates given by the model output.
- What does it mean to assess model fit?
- Describe the assumptions of the simple linear regression model
- Assess whether the assumptions of the simple linear regression model have been violated.
- Recognise from an exploratory plot when an interaction between a continuous and a categorical explanatory variable is appropriate


## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- How the mean, variance and standard deviation are caculated and interpreted
- The definitions of the standard error and the 95% confidence interval
- How we can visualise the linear association between two variables
- What do each of the components in the equation of a simple linear regression model represent?
- How we can fit a simple linear regression model with one continuous explanatory variable in R
- How R can be used to obtain predictions from a simple linear regression model

## Software installation

You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of *both* R ***and*** RStudio before coming to the course

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN. Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

### Mac

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from CRAN. Also, please install the free [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 

### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install free [the RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
